# Changelog

## v0.0.12 - 2026-05-18

My Team page now defers to Yahoo's live game-day numbers and only overlays nba.com data on Average Stats > current season.

- New banner on every My Team sub-tab other than Average Stats > current season, with a one-click switch button.
- All stat-tab clicks on the My Team page now do a full page reload so the extension always picks up the new state cleanly. Outside the stat-tab nav (player anchors, etc.) Yahoo's behavior is unchanged.
- Season string is dynamic; rolls forward automatically each July.

## v0.0.11 - 2026-05-18

Four post-release fixes against v0.0.10's spider tooltip:

- Pinned card stays open while you change the per-mode dropdown (the filter bar is now a safe area for the dismissal logic).
- USG% in the tooltip multiplies by 100 to match the conventional 0-100 scale of the injected USG% column.
- "No NBA mapping. Fix in Options." softened to "No NBA mapping for this player yet." while the Options page is still future work.
- Refresh button now also invalidates the cached NBA player list, and the `ROSTERSTATUS === 1` filter is dropped, so injured / two-way / G-League players can map without waiting for season rollover.

## v0.0.10 - 2026-05-18

Spider tooltip ships. Hover any player name on My Team or Players for a 300 ms preview, click to pin. Three overlapping polygons (Season gray, L10 teal, L5 gold) on 9 axes (3PM, PTS, REB, AST, STL, BLK, TO inverted, TS%, USG%) on league-percentile scale, with raw values stacked next to each axis.

States: loading, ready, no mapping, fetch failed. Dismiss with ESC, the X button, clicking outside, or pinning a different player. Per-mode changes refresh the polygons in place.

New SW message `getSpiderData` lazily fetches all three windows at the current per-mode and caches league percentiles. Pure SVG renderer with no chart library dependency.

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-17-spider-tooltip-plan.md`. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-17-spider-tooltip-design.md`.

## v0.0.9 - 2026-05-17

Filter bar wordmark recoloured from the original purple to brand blue moon (`#2D4A5B`).

## v0.0.8 - 2026-05-17

Primary logo and brand color land. The mark is a top-down view of a 3-point arc with a ball at the apex plus a hoop and backboard at the bottom. Primary colorway is a deep blue radial gradient (`#4A6E84 -> #2D4A5B -> #1F3645`). Three alternates ship in `docs/logo-samples/`: black gradient, mint gradient, and a flat white tile. New `npm run icons` script rasterizes any SVG colorway to PNG at 16/32/48/128.

## v0.0.7 - 2026-05-16

Demoted the "no stats table found" log from `warn` to `debug` so it stops surfacing in the `chrome://extensions` Errors panel on pages where fNBA does not inject anything.

## v0.0.6 - 2026-05-16

Yahoo's combined `FGM/A` and the derived `A/T` cell now update with filter-aware values. Added `CompoundColumnDef` (made + attempted + separator + Yahoo header label) and `DerivedColumnDef` (numerator / denominator) and route both alongside `BASE_OVERRIDE_COLUMNS` in the renderer.

Also fixes a quietly wrong merge: nba.com's `MeasureType=Advanced` returns season totals for counting stats regardless of the requested PerMode. Reversed the merge order in `mergeStats.ts` so Base wins on overlap, and locked in with four unit tests.

FTM and FTA shipped as separate columns and FT% is now derived from the displayed FTM/FTA so the three numbers visually agree at any PerMode.

## v0.0.5 - 2026-05-16

Smoke-driven fixes from the first live-Yahoo session. Includes the URL pattern fix for My Team's numeric team-id (`/nba/<leagueId>/<numericTeamId>`).

## v0.0.4 - 2026-05-16

My Team page support. Two-pass `ensureTableFits` algorithm: collect ancestor widths first, then mutate, so Yahoo's flex/grid containers do not reflow mid-walk. Lowered the narrowing-point threshold from 1.2x to 1.05x so My Team's `.RailResponsive`/`.Rail` ratio of 1.16 is caught.

## v0.0.3 - 2026-05-16

Viewport-scaled breathing room around the stats table. Padding at the narrowing-point ancestor: `min(200px, 8vw)` on the left, `min(250px, 10vw)` on the right. Cap at 2400 px on ultra-wide monitors.

## v0.0.2 - 2026-05-15

Content overlay lands on the Players page. Filter bar mounts above the stats table with Window / Per-mode / Refresh / status. Three new columns (eFG%, TS%, USG%). Yahoo's traditional stats (PTS, REB, AST, ST, BLK, 3PTM, FG%, FT%, TO) override with filter-aware values from nba.com. Sort direction preserved across filter changes.

## v0.0.1 - 2026-05-15

Foundation. MV3 service worker with header-spoofing via `declarativeNetRequest`, throttled queue, IndexedDB cache, and Yahoo-to-NBA player ID mapping. Typed message router. No UI yet; verifiable from the SW DevTools console via `fnba.*` debug handles.
